# Chart Replicator

## Make chart creation for trends less tedious

If you're using EBO BMS software, you’re probably familiar with the tedious process of creating hundreds (or even thousands) of charts from trends. This tool is here to save you from that monotony and make the task much quicker and easier.

You can download the .exe version or build it yourself—whichever you prefer. The setup process is straightforward, and the steps are outlined below:

### Here’s what you’ll need to provide:

1. **File name** – Pretty self-explanatory.
2. **EBO Version** – This works with version 6 or later.
3. **Analog and Binary Trend Paths** – These are relative to your EBO system.
4. **Trend Names** – You can copy and paste these directly from your EBO software.

Once you’ve filled out all the details, you can proceed to configure the display settings for each trend:

When you're done, simply click "Build," and the generated file will appear in your `./output` folder.

Once you import the file into EBO, you should see something like this:
